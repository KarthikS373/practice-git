Basic etiquette for open source projects
----------------------------------------

1. Why we want to contribute to Open source : 
        - fix a bug & make software better
        - help others who use the tool to have better experience
        - improve skill in a particular topic
        - publicly demonstrate skills by contributing ( a. part of course, b. to enhance own for a job )

        NOTE - One should not contribute to troll/boss around or show off how amazing that person is.

2. The maintainers :
        - Use proper labels to guide people to issues
        - describe the issues properly so that it is understandable even as a beginner
        - write a comment explaining the reason if one is closing a PR and decide not to merge
        - ensure to enforce the code of conduct properly
        

3. As a user :
        - Thank people if they help you, Congratulate people when necessary, respond respectfully to people
        - Choose effective contributions like triage issues, fix code, debug errors, mentor people that are trying to make fixes
        - Read the manual and understande the project as well as the issues - feel free to ask for help and Always try to build up knowledge of the project
        - Make progress, not noise  make sure a fix is useful, and that it doesn't make other contributor's jobs harder
                                -> Discuss one topic per issue 
                                -> Fix one issue per PR 
                                -> Ask questions using other mechanisms like chat rooms or forums
                                -> Read the manual properly
        - Be patient, be timely - PR reviews and issues may take time be patient and try to politely reach out the maintainers as a follow up


        Don't:
        - Complicate issues by trying to discuss multiple topics at once, or making off-topic comments.
        - Try to cram multiple fixes into a single pull request. It makes it a lot harder to review, and raises suspicions (some people might think you are trying to hide some malicious code in between the valid changes).
        - Open lots of issues asking vague questions.
        - Ask questions without trying to solve the problem yourself first.
